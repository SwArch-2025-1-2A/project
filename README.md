## Setup

Clone this repository adding the `--recurse-submodules` flag, e.g:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:SwArch-2025-1-2A/project.git
```

This should also pull the changes within each [submodule](#git-submodules).

If you forgot the `--recurse-submodules` or need to update the submodules themselves
you can just go [here](#updating-submodules)

### Git submodules

We are using [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
to manage each service.

> [!TIP]
> In order to have an easier time with git submodules, run the following
> commands. This will allow you to use these seamlessly (`--global` is completely
> optional).

```sh
git config --global push.recurseSubmodules on-demand
git config --global submodule.recurse true
```

> [!NOTE]
> Once you have excecuted these commands every time you `pull`/`fetch` changes
your modules will get updated. So if you move between branches you can just
`git pull` and you're good to go.

In case you want to manually update your submodules. Please refer to
[updating submodules](#updating-submodules).

#### Updating submodules

Once you have read about [git submodules](#git-submodules), you can understand
that these hold a SHA to a commit. So we have two ways of updating them if you
cannot configure the recommended configs.

1. Initialize, fetch and checkout any nested submodule with the _local status_
reference:

    ```sh
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

1. Initialize, fetch and checkout any nested submodule with the status of their
remote-tracking branch:

    ```sh
    git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
    ```

## Running the project

### Running with Docker Compose

Make sure the submodules are [up-to-date](#updating-submodules) to avoid
possible issues with stale state.

#### Setting up the needed environment variables

In order for you to run the project, you need a .env file with various variables.
You can find a good and functional example of a .env file in .env.example, and you
can run the following command to get the environment variables needed:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Build the project and run it

```sh
docker compose --profile prod up --build
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to include the flag --profile prod, as it is needed for
> various services, which run in prod mode when running the whole project.

#### Run the project without building

```sh
docker compose --profile prod up
```

#### Partially clean enviroment

> [!TIP]
> If you want to have a _almost_ clean build you need to stop
> and remove containers, networks by running:

```sh
docker compose --profile prod down --remove-orphans
```

#### Fully clean environment

> [!WARNING]
> The following command gives you a clean slate to start from, but it
> remove the volumes too. So any data that you may have, it will be
> removed as well.

```sh
docker compose --profile prod down --remove-orphans --volumes
